## Core Models: Powering ChatGPT in 2025

ChatGPT’s capabilities stem from its advanced language models, each optimized for specific tasks. Here’s an overview of the current lineup:

| Model            | Availability           | Key Strengths                              | Context Window |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|
| GPT-5 (standard) | ChatGPT Plus / Team    | Best overall reasoning, writing, coding    | 128k–400k      |
| GPT-5 Pro        | ChatGPT Pro            | Highest intelligence, research-grade       | 400k+          |
| o3 / o3-mini     | Plus & Pro             | Advanced reasoning & math (replaces o1)     | 200k           |
| GPT-4.5          | Free tier (limited)    | Balanced speed & quality                   | 128k           |
| GPT-4o (legacy)  | Free tier              | Fast multimodal responses                  | 128k           |

The o3 series, in particular, has gained traction among professionals. Its enhanced problem-solving abilities make it ideal for math, science, and complex logical tasks.

Meanwhile, GPT-5 Pro remains the go-to for research teams and enterprises. It excels at deep analysis of large datasets.

## Key Features (2025 Update)

ChatGPT’s feature set has expanded significantly since its early days. Here are the standout capabilities:

### 1. Multimodal Intelligence
- **Vision**: Analyze architecture diagrams, UI screenshots, or hand-drawn sketches. It can generate code or explanations based on these inputs.
- **Voice**: Engage in natural, emotion-aware voice conversations with low latency. This is perfect for brainstorming or hands-free use.
- **DALL·E 3 Integration**: Generate high-quality images directly within chats. It supports detailed prompts and style customization.

### 2. Canvas Workspace
A game-changer for collaborative work:
- **For Developers**: Highlight code snippets to debug, refactor, or translate between languages. No need to rewrite entire files.
- **For Creators**: Edit text sections for tone, length, or clarity. You’ll preserve chat context while making changes.

### 3. Advanced Data Analysis
Upload Excel, CSV, PDF, or JSON files to:
- Automatically clean and process data using sandboxed Python execution.
- Generate visualizations (charts, heatmaps, and interactive graphs).
- Extract actionable insights from large datasets.

### 4. Custom GPTs & Memory
- **Custom GPTs**: Build specialized agents (e.g., "React Debugger" or "SEO Content Optimizer"). These use custom knowledge bases.
- **Adaptive Memory**: Learns user preferences (e.g., "Use TypeScript for all examples"). This reduces repetitive prompting.

### 5. Real-Time Capabilities
- Web browsing (Plus & above) for up-to-date information.
- Deep Research mode (o3-powered) for 10–20 page reports. These include cited sources.

## Pricing Tiers: Which Plan Fits You?

OpenAI offers flexible pricing to suit individual and organizational needs:

| Plan             | Price (USD)       | Key Benefits                                      |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Free             | $0                | GPT-4.5 + GPT-4o, limited usage, basic web browsing |
| ChatGPT Plus     | $20 / month       | GPT-5, o3, unlimited GPT-4o, Advanced Voice, 128k context |
| ChatGPT Team     | $25–$30 / user/mo | Everything in Plus + team workspace, admin controls, data exclusion from training |
